1.At First Take two prime numbers (p) & (q) as inputs.

2.Then N=P*Q

3.f=(P-1)*(Q-1)

4.Now pick a variable 'e' which range is 1<e<f.

5.Then Pick e which is Co-prime with f and N .

6.We will get a number from the process e

7.At last we have to solve d= Inverse of (e mod f)

8.From the process 7 we will get the Number d

9.So (n,e)is the encryption key and (n,d)is the decryption key
