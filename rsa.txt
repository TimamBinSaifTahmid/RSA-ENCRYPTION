1.At First we Take two prime numbers (p) & (q) as inputs.

2.Then N=P*Q

3.f=(P-1)*(Q-1)

4.Now pick a variable 'e' which range is 1<e<f
    which is Co-prime with f and N .

5.Then we take a string str to encript.

6.We  run a for loop to find Encripted message String E.

7.E[i]=( ( positional value of str[i] ) ^ e ) mod N

8.Then we finally get encripted message E.

9.Now decription key d= Inverse of (e mod f)

10.Then we take a string str1 to decript.

11.We  run a for loop to find Decripted message String D.

12.D[i]=( ( positional value of str1[i] ) ^ d ) mod N

13.Then we finally get decripted message D.
