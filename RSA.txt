1.At First Take two prime numbers (p) & (q) as inputs.

2.Then N=P*Q

3.H(N)=(P-1)*(Q-1)

4.Now pick a variable 'e' which range is 1<e<H(N)

5.Then Pick Co-prime of e , H(N) and N .

6.We will get a number from the process "5"

7.At last we have to solve d= Inverse of (e mod H(N))

8.From the process 7 we will get the Number

9.So (n,e)is the encryption key and (n,d)is the decryption key
